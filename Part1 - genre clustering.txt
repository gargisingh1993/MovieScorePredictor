1. select 10 genres from all the genres which have moste movies made in them -> done

2. Now for a particular genre, we find all the movies in the genre ->done

3. From all the movies in this genre, we find all the actors who acted in this genre -> done

4. now for a particular actor, we get all the movies in this genre -> pending

4.1 - I have a data frame vector3 which contains c(actor1, actor2, actor3, genre)
4.2 - I need to find all the movies done by an actor in a particular genre , say horror or comedy [a dataframe which contains actor name , the movies of one particular genre , and the genre] from moviedata.
4.3 - We have to match the genre column of vector3 and moviedata, so that we get the movies of that particular genre , done by an actor say abc
4.4 - Once we have this data frame we can proceed with clustering






5. Say for actor A, we get 10 movies
6. Now we can classify all the 10 movies by giving every movie a label from 1 to 10. This label is the goodness of the movie.
7. We can average the movie goodness for all the 10 movies to get the goodness of the actor in this particular genre.
8. We repeat this process for about 10 actors in about 10 genres.1. select 10 genres from all the genres which have moste movies made in them -> done
2. Now for a particular genre, we find all the movies in the genre ->done
3. From all the movies in this genre, we find all the actors who acted in this genre -> done
4. now for a particular actor, we get all the movies in this genre -> pending
5. Say for actor A, we get 10 movies
6. Now we can classify all the 10 movies by giving every movie a label from 1 to 10. This label is the goodness of the movie.
7. We can average the movie goodness for all the 10 movies to get the goodness of the actor in this particular genre.
8. We repeat this process for about 10 actors in about 10 genres.
