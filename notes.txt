1. select 10 genres from all the genres which have more movies made in them
2. Now for a particular genre, we find all the movies in the genre
3. From all the movies in this genre, we find all the actors who acted in this genre
4. now for a particular actor, we get all the movies in this genre
5. Say for actor A, we get 10 movies
6. Now we can classify all the 10 movies by giving every movie a label from 1 to 10. This label is the goodness of the movie.
7. We can average the movie goodness for all the 10 movies to get the goodness of the actor in this particular genre.
8. We repeat this process for about 10 actors in about 10 genres.
9. Now for a actor, we have his goodness rating in all the 10 genres. Using this data, the actor can pick a genre for his next movie.
10. This approach can be extended with a pair of actors and repeating steps from 5.(Idea given by professor.
Problem: We have very less data when we take the combination of actors because at max there are 5 - 10 movies in common for a pair of actors)
11. This approach can be extended with a pair of genres for a particular actor
12. Professor also talked about network analysis, we have no idea about how to approach this problem. Idea is that we have to draw a network diagram where a pair of successful actors in a genre are closer and two actors who never worked together in a genre are very far away in the diagram.
